    <h3>About the designer</h3>
    <p>Diane von Furstenberg arrived in New York in 1970 with a suitcase full of her iconic wrap dresses and changed the way women dressed. DVF has pioneered fashion and business, built and sold a cosmetics company and founded a publishing house, and she supports many philanthropic causes— especially for women and the environment. DVF returned from a hiatus to fashion in 1997, relaunching the signature wrap to international acclaim. In 2005 the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) awarded her a Lifetime Achievement Award, and the following year named her as the Council President.</p>
