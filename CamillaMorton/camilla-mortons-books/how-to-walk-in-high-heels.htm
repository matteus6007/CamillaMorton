    <p>'How to Walk in High Heels' is for anyone who has ever tried to change a plug, toss a salad, enter a room in sling backs and leave everyone captivated, and was clearly absent when that manual was given out. This is the How To for the modern girl – you have to multitask and have the Midas touch in everything.  Get the look but above all get the knowledge.  This is a how to that is meant to be a friend, not a condescending assortment of rules because just like the reader the author is baffled by life&#8230; and like the reader she craves the easiest, most painless solution&#8230; and if they are stylish and fabulous and from someone iconic so much the better.</p>
    <p>I never knew I was going to write a book – that was not in the plan – but then again the best things aren't. Why did I do this? Could it have been the blancmange bowl that was forever stuck over my last remaining light bulb in Paris, that no man or mechanic could remove&#8230; Or was is that one day, when on deadline, I called John Lewis in a blind panic when my computer had crashed.  I was talked through the procedure to save my frozen laptop with all the details as if I was in an episode of ER, only George Clooney was not assisting and this episode had been dubbed in some strange foreign language. I could not understand a word&#8230;did everyone know how to do all these things? If so where was the manual? Being a rational girl, A levels, Degree, perfectly capable but a computer crash reduced me to a jibbering wreck. I decided if I could walk on cobblestones in heels by hell would I work out how to turn on my computer.. (*turns out the plug had fallen out&#8230; but manual didn't advise you check THAT did it&#8230;)   So from one disaster to the next.  I was in Paris, had just been robbed and decided that was it – I needed a life change.  I sat in the studio and thought.  John and Steven told me to write a list of all the things I knew how to do – and all the things I wanted to know how to do&#8230;. The list of things I couldn't do and didn't know got longer and longer&#8230; And that evening the idea for the book was born.</p>
    <p>How to Walk in High Heels took the world by storm.  Its flippant fashion tone, quotes and 'how tos' from industry star contributors sit against demystified jargon. Just as every girl needs to walk talk and slim in heels – every girl needs this book.   Think of Ginger Rogers – she had to do all the same moves as Fred Astaire, only backwards and in heels – now its time for you to get the tips to take centre stage.</p>
