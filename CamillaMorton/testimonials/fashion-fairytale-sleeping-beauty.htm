        <p class="quote">"Any story that begins with the words "once upon a time" is pretty much guaranteed to follow a well-trod narrative path but in the hands of Camilla Morton, fairy tales are taking a very fashionable twist accompanied with theatrical illustrations by Lacroix himself, made from hand sketches and computer graphics to vividly accompany each page."</p>

        <p class="quote">"Ms. Morton has successfully taken the details of Mr. Lacroix's life and has woven them into the fabric of the fairy tale . . . pun intended. With accompanying images, the story and art are combined in a most engaging technique—odd and surprising and fresh in a way one rarely experiences in fashion memoirs." </p>

        <p class="quote">"I'm so excited about my soon to be new book Christian Lacroix and the Tale of Sleeping Beauty by Camilla Morton. Illustrated by Christian Lacroix and composed by Morton, it's the first in a series of fashion tales including memoirs of other designers such as Diane Von Furstenberg and Manolo Blahnik."</p>

        <p class="quote">"Like Lacroix haute couture, the pages are a glorious mix of things - contrasting fonts and colours playing with the electric illustrations. It's an extraordinary book; Morton retells the fairytale classic as delicious fashion fiction - though firmly rooted in the bitchy reality of the industry, particularly that of fashion editors - working Lacroix in as a central character alongside Beauty, a fantastical biography of sorts. I was going to describe my favourite details but that would spoil it - if you haven't yet read it I wouldn't want to steal those sweet moments of discovery away from you." </p>

        <p class="quote">"The first in a new series of fairy tales and fashion, Christian Lacroix and the Tale of Sleeping Beauty is a gorgeously illustrated book that alternates between the lives of Sleeping Beauty and Christian Lacroix. I might not have been interested in reading a simple biography of Lacroix, but I was fascinated to learn more about him in this context. Part of the charm was the interspersing of his story with the familiar fairy tale, but an even more integral part were the gorgeous illustrations, done by Lacroix himself."</p>

        <p class="quote">"Interlaced with the story of Sleeping Beauty, the story of former couturier Christian Lacroix is told in the fanciful style now trademarked by author Camilla Morton in this, the first installation of her Fashion Fairytale Memoir Series. In the series, a "once upon a time" story is inventively re-imagined with bits of real-life story intertwined with a time tested fairy tale to create a wholly new story where the reader is left to wonder where fanciful fact & fiction begin & end. The storyline of this premier volume is further authenticated by the illustrations throughout the story, which were done by the title subject & flamboyant couturier himself, Mr. Christian Lacroix. Lightheartedly written, beautifully illustrated & even more beautifully covered, this title will serve as a quick summer read & makes a wonderful gift. But get ready… with the next title in the series being about shoe designer extraordinaire, Manolo Blahnik, I suspect that after you buy this first edition, a full collection of every title is in your future."</p>
